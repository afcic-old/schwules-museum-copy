## SCHWULES MUSEUM WEBSITE COPY

This was a website I alway really liked for how different and busy it was, in a world where everyone strives for minimalism, it feels quite camp. This was my second project I did after the Bootcamp.

# WHAT I USED

I used HTML, SCSS and vanilla JavaScript for this project. I also wanted to try out jQuery for fun, so as the last part of this project I translated my JavaScript into jQuery.

# WHAT I LEARNED

My main interest in replicating this homepage, was to learn how to make all the nav bars and more importantly, the events, exhibition and archive sliders. I got most of my answers through googling for different parts of the projects and building it together. I also decided to use SCSS, since I haven't used it before. SCSS was really fun and easy to use, I couldn't believe that's not how CSS was built. It made everything really easy to use and quick to write.

# WHERE TO FIND IT

I used GitHub pages to deploy the website : https://afcic.github.io/schwules-museum-copy/
